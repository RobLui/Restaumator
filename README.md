# Restaumator

Restaurant automator 

Simplify someone who's working in the horeca industry by automatisating the way people drink/eat/want to pay

By example:
	Someone has to wait for the bill, untill a waiter sees or hears them.
	With our project we want to change the way you have to wait for something.
	Every second less spend waiting is one won.
