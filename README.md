# Restaumator

## = [Restaurant automator]

Automate the process of being served in a restaurant, instead of having to call a waiter, waiters will get notifications as soon as you run out of liquids.

Example:

Someone has to wait for the bill, untill a waiter sees or hears them. With our project we want to change the way you have to wait for something. Every second less spend waiting is one won.
